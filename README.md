# Web Scraping
This repository is a collection of web scrapers. The scrapers use different libraries/packages such as Selenium, beautifulsoup, scrapy etc.
The wqeb scrapers so far focus on either news websites or social media.


# Why is it useful?
The program can not only be used to scrape mainstream media but also 'news' websites that promote fake news. 
Having this information, various NLP tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, topic modeling) can be performed on the scraped content.
