# Web_Scraping
This program uses selenium webdriver and beautifulsoup to scrape news articles. The information is stored in a data frame (and optionally saved in a CSV file).
The program accesses the website via TOR and PhantomJS and scrapes a number of articles from a certain category (e.g. politics, sports).

# Why is it useful?
The program can not only be used to scrape mainstream media but also 'news' websites that promote fake news. 
Having this information, various NLP tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, topic modeling) can be performed on the scraped content.
